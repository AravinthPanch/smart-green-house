Imagine you are a university student and you live far away from your family. You live in an unknown town and no one cares about you. You have to wash the dishes yourself and you have to take care about your clothes. In addition your mother gave you same very beautiful plants. Now you want to go to your holidays and travel around Europe for some weeks and you have no idea how to pour your very beautiful plants during this time.
